            <p>
                Hi, I'm Niwesh Waiba, a BIM student currently studying at KIST College. I have a strong passion
                for technology and enjoy exploring various aspects of it. As a tech enthusiast, I am always eager to
                learn and
                keep up with the latest trends and advancements in the field.

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I have a particular interest in cybersecurity, as it combines my fascination with technology and my
                desire to
                ensure the safety and privacy of digital systems. I am constantly exploring and improving my knowledge
                in
                this area to contribute to creating secure digital environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I have a keen interest in Linux and operating systems. I find the flexibility, security,
                and
                open-source nature of Linux to be incredibly fascinating. Exploring different distributions and learning
                how
                to navigate the command line has been a rewarding experience for me. I believe that understanding
                operating
                systems is essential for any tech professional, and it enables me to have a deeper understanding of how
                software and hardware interact.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my interests in cybersecurity and Linux, I have experience in programming languages such
                as
                Java and PHP. I find joy in developing software solutions and creating efficient and reliable
                applications. I
                am always open to new opportunities and challenges that allow me to apply my skills and expand my
                expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy gaming and exploring new technologies. It's exciting to see how
                technology continues to shape our world and influence our lives. I believe in the power of technology to
                drive positive change and make a difference in society.
            </p>
            <p>
